# Maze-Game1
As you all know, a maze is a structure surrounded by walls with numerous paths and passages, making it difficult for anyone to pass from one end of the maze to the other. Just like the actual maze, I developed a game which will have big walls as border and small internal walls to create confusion for the player. This Game have many Function like : 
- 1-Levels the game have many level from easy level to hard one 
- 2-every level have time you should reach to the final before finishing the time or you will replay the game again 
- 3-Switch between multiple Charachters 
- 4-Pause the game in anytime and resume it too -
- 5-for every Level have own music ..
# Here we will see some Photo of the game ,i wish you like it !
